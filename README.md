Android Automation using UIAutomator
=================

This contains automation test scripts for Android Apps.

‘UI Automator’ is used for executing Automation scripts for Android under UI Testing. UI testing ensures that the app returns the correct UI output in response to a user actions on a device, say keyboard input or pressing toolbars, menus, dialogs, images, and other UI controls. It reduces a lot of manual testing job and saves a lot of time.

Android SDK provides with uiautomator , a java library to automate and run the tests. Along with this , it also provides a GUI tool called uiautomatorviewer to inspect the layout hierarchy and view the properties of the individual UI components on your test device.
